                My name is Daivaras Šlipaitis, and I am 25 years old. <img class="a" src=../img/IMG_2560.JPG width="250" height="300">
                I have chosen to study ICT HBO-ICT programme at HZ university of applied sciences as I believe that technology
                is
                already improving the world and can even further improve it in the future.
                Looking over the past 30 years a lot of things have changed in an incredible speed due to the
                improved technology.
                As humans are improving the technology in such a pace, I have decided that I want to learn about, so I could
                understand how
                it works and be able to use and apply for even further improvements around the world.

                I have grown up in small village in Lithuania and I lived there till around 15 years old.
                My point of view at the time was very narrow, as the village I lived at had only population of 500 people.
                However, when I was 15 years old, I’ve moved to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius> Vilnius</a> the
                capital of Lithuania, furthermore when I was 19
                years old,
                I moved to live in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham> Birmingham</a>, United Kingdom. The move
                from small village to bigger city and even bigger after
                that and
                traveling to different countries have completely changed the way I see the world. <img class="b" src=../img/vilnius.jpg

                Traveling and moving around allowed me to meet a lot of new people and get inspired by them and as well to see
                how beautiful this world is.
                Due to that I like to call myself a world citizen and not Lithuanian as I want to strive for the global
                improvement, especially for the ones in need,
                in the poorer countries.
