            My name is Daivaras Šlipaitis, and I am 25 years old. <img class="a" src=IMG_2560.jpg width="250" height="300">
            I have chosen to study ICT HBO-ICT programme at HZ university of applied sciences as I believe that technology
            is
            already improving the world and can even further improve it in the future.
            Looking over the past 30 years a lot of things have changed in an incredible speed due to the
            improved technology.
            As humans are improving the technology in such a pace, I have decided that I want to learn about, so I could
            understand how
            it works and be able to use and apply for even further improvements around the world.

            I have grown up in small village in Lithuania and I lived there till around 15 years old.
            My point of view at the time was very narrow, as the village I lived at had only population of 500 people.
            However, when I was 15 years old, I’ve moved to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius> Vilnius</a> the
            capital of Lithuania, furthermore when I was 19
            years old,
            I moved to live in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham> Birmingham</a>, United Kingdom. The move
            from small village to bigger city and even bigger after
            that and
            traveling to different countries have completely changed the way I see the world. <img class="b" src=vilnius.jpg
                                                                                                   width="1000" height="400">
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="column">
            Traveling and moving around allowed me to meet a lot of new people and get inspired by them and as well to see
            how beautiful this world is.
            Due to that I like to call myself a world citizen and not Lithuanian as I want to strive for the global
            improvement, especially for the ones in need,
            in the poorer countries.
